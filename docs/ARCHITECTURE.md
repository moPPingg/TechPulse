# Architecture Reference

**Full system architecture** (data flow, transformation steps, module responsibilities) is in the project root:

→ **[../SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md](../SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)**

That document covers: raw news and price → ingest → storage → signals → ML → API → frontend, with tables for each transformation step.

For **news intelligence** design and engine API, see [NEWS_INTELLIGENCE_ENGINE.md](NEWS_INTELLIGENCE_ENGINE.md).
