**Purpose:** Structured self-study curriculum and reference for the TechPulse financial intelligence system. Everything here connects directly to the codebase.

**Start here:** [LEARNING_PATH.md](LEARNING_PATH.md) — order of study, what each section builds, and how it maps to the project and career paths.

**Reference:**
- [HOW_TO_RUN_AND_EXTEND.md](HOW_TO_RUN_AND_EXTEND.md) — Run locally, debug checklist, how to extend.
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) — Points to root [SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md](../SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md) for full data flow.
- [NEWS_INTELLIGENCE_ENGINE.md](NEWS_INTELLIGENCE_ENGINE.md) — News engine design, API, and tradeoffs.
- [NEWS_INTELLIGENCE_DESIGN.md](NEWS_INTELLIGENCE_DESIGN.md) — Design rationale for news pipeline and relevance scoring.

**Curriculum (numbered folders):**
- [01_foundations](01_foundations/) — ML basics, time series, leakage (beginner).
- [02_modeling](02_modeling/) — Forecasting models in this project (intermediate).
- [03_multimodal](03_multimodal/) — News data and analysis in this project (intermediate).
- [04_advanced](04_advanced/) — Event-aware and tail-aware training (advanced).
- [05_evaluation](05_evaluation/) — Leakage control and tail metrics (research-level).

Optimized for deep understanding, not coverage. No unrelated theory; no fluff.
